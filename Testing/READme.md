# Testing

This folder is used for testing key features of the `Brooks_MFC_UART_to_RS485_Embedded_C_Driver`.

It contains test code and resources to help verify functionality during development.

Refer to test.py file if its your first time working with Brooks UART to RS485 comms, it's a simple serial comms command testing environment allowing you to learn from scratch how the S-Protocol (HART based protocol works)

Everything is designed from simple bytes over UART so that you understand whats going on the protocol level and you can scale up by trying your own implementations.
